## Polkadot API

The [Polkadot API](https://github.com/polkadot-api/polkadot-api), also known as PAPI, is a modular and light-client friendly set of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) libraries to interact with Polkadot chains.

PAPI is compatible with every major JavaScript / TypeScript development framework, such as:

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- etc..

You can use PAPI power any project using JavaScript or Typescript such as:

- Front-end interfaces
- CLIs
